# Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains projects completed as part of the **Deep Learning Specialization** on Coursera, presented by DeepLearning.AI. Each project covers a crucial aspect of deep learning, providing hands-on experience with neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, and more. These projects highlight skills in designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models for various real-world tasks.

## Overview

The projects in this repository span the following areas of deep learning:

- **Neural Network Foundations**: Implementing basic neural networks and training models from scratch.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Designing and implementing CNNs for image recognition tasks.
- **Sequence Models**: Working with RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for time-series and natural language processing tasks.
- **Generative Models**: Applying GANs to generate new, synthetic data.
- **Practical Applications**: Applying deep learning models to tasks such as image classification, object detection, and language translation.

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

1. **Neural Network Basics**: Building and training a neural network from scratch, understanding forward and backward propagation, and exploring basic optimization techniques.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Developing CNNs for image classification, working with architectures like LeNet, VGG, and ResNet.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Creating RNNs for text generation and sequence prediction tasks, implementing LSTM and GRU cells.
4. **Object Detection and Localization**: Implementing a YOLO-based object detection model for identifying objects in images.
5. **Neural Style Transfer**: Applying CNNs to transfer artistic styles between images.
6. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Using GANs to generate new images and explore concepts like the generator-discriminator architecture.
